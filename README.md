## üéØ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to design an efficient and accurate ADC for low-power wearable devices. The design focuses on a 10-bit monotonic SAR-ADC architecture utilizing a **time-domain comparator** to achieve power consumption in the microwatt range.

The final post-layout design is ready for fabrication, achieving a power consumption of **23.25 ¬µW** and an Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) of **6.44 bits**. The design has been verified to accurately acquire PPG signals, making it suitable for biomedical applications.

## üìä Key Specifications

The final specifications from the post-layout simulation are as follows:

| Parameter | Typical | Unit |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Technology** | CMOS 180nm | - |
| **Supply Voltage** | 1.80 | V |
| **Resolution** | 10 | bits |
| **Input Voltage Range** | 0 - 1.8 | V |
| **Conversion Time** | 5.2 | ¬µs |
| **Power Consumption** | **23.25** | **¬µW** |
| **ENOB** | **6.44** | **bits** |
| **SNR** | 41.03 | dB |
| **THD** | -50.11 | dB |
| **INL** | -3 / +3 | LSB |
| **DNL** | -1 / +4 | LSB |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Details

The design is based on the **Monotonic Switching SAR-ADC** architecture, which is known for its power efficiency and smaller capacitor array requirements.

The core innovation lies in the **Time Domain Comparator**, which is based on a Voltage-Controlled Delay Line (VCDL). This approach significantly reduces power consumption compared to traditional dynamic comparators.

**Key Components:**
1.  **Track/Hold (T/H) Switch**: A Bootstrapped Switch for input signal sampling.
2.  **Capacitive DAC (CDAC)**: Generates the reference voltage for comparison.
3.  **Time Domain Comparator**: The low-power VCDL-based comparator.
4.  **SAR Logic**: Controls the successive approximation algorithm.
